## Task1 Regularizing Curve
Curvetopia is a project focused on regularizing hand-drawn curves by identifying and standardizing regular shapes within them. The algorithm targets the following shapes:

- Straight Lines
- Circles and Ellipses
- Rectangles and Rounded Rectangles
- Regular Polygons
- Star Shapes

The algorithm can optionally convert line art images into polylines, and it will be tested on various images to ensure its effectiveness in distinguishing and regularizing these shapes.

To run the above tasks in a folder:

1. Run the script `create_dataset.py`.
3. Then run the script `model_training.py` for model training and evaluation. Change the path of the image to be predicted.
